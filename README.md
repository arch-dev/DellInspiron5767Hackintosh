## Guide

### IMPORTANT NOTE
If you are upgrading from OpenCore v0.6.2 you **MUST replace the whole OC folder with the one generated from build script (adding missing files as per guide)** and **EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi** file otherwise you will not able to boot again from MacOS. You **CANNOT just replace files or add/remove missing ones** since from v0.6.2 to v0.6.7 lot of things changed as well as lot of ACPI lines changed from previous Dell BIOS version to latest one.

### Requirements
1. Running on macOS, Windows or Linux (on Windows you can use WSL https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL/releases) for macOS; [acpidump](https://www.acpica.org/downloads) for Windows
3. Curl installed (if not just run the script and complete the installation process)
4. USB 2.0 flash drive 12 GB or more (if you have **USB 3.0 plug in into USB 2.0** port during booting phase otherwise it will not be recognized)
5. Internet connection (obviously :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

### BIOS setup
1. Make sure your BIOS is up to date. If not install latest from Dell site
2. Reboot to BIOS Setup
3. Enable Boot from USB and Legacy boot
4. Disable Fast boot and Secure boot
5. Disable Intel VT-d
6. Make sure SATA mode is set to AHCI

### Bootable USB creation
Just follow official OpenCore guide here: [Creating the USB](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/)
    
### EFI Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Run build.sh from terminal (if using WSL on Windows first install `dos2unix` and run `dos2unix build.sh` to convert the script to unix format)
3. Open `Out/EFI/OC/config.plist` and follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html#platforminfo) to correctly fill `"PlatformInfo">"Generic"` empty fields (**Do not change `"SystemProductName"` value, just use the given one**)
4. Run `build.sh` script and wait while it prepares the *EFI* folder for you (it may takes long depending on you internet connection quality)
5. Then copy entire *EFI* folder to your USB flash drive EFI partition you created previously. It should look like the following

5. Now it's time to boot macOS installer from your USB drive

### macOS installation
1. On OpenCore boot screen select *"Install macOS from your_usb"*

2. Assuming your are dual booting with Windows once you have reached install screen choose *"macOS Installation"*

3. Select target partition created before and follow the installer

### Post installation
1. Download [MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) script and run it

2. Select HDD macOS partition to mount EFI

3. Open your USB drive and head to EFI folder

4. Copy `BOOT` and `OC` folders to HDD EFI partition (if you've previously installed CLOVER first make a backup, then delete `CLOVER` folder and `BOOT/BOOTx64.efi` or just replace it with OC's one)

5. Follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html#checking-via-verifymsre2) to disable "CFG Lock" (Remember to disable `"AppleCpuPmCfgLock"` and `"AppleXcpmCfgLock"` under `"Kernel">"Quirks"` once done)
    
6. Open System Preferences and disable PowerNap and wake on ethernet under *"Energy Saving"*

7. (Only if you installed previous jack fix: head over `/usr/local/bin` and remove `ALCPlugFix-Swift` then remove `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.black-dragon74.ALCPlugFix.plist` and the `alcplugfix_config.plist` file). Run script `Audio/MicFix_WingLim/install.sh` to fix 3.5mm headphones' mic

8. Fix iServices following [these instructions](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html).

9. (Optional) If you are dual booting with Windows or Linux, follow [these instructions](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootstrap.html#prerequisites) to prevent issues where either Windows or Linux try to overwrite the `EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi` path.
